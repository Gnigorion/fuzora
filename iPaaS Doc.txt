AMQP Trigger - 
{ 
	"auth": {
			"host": "",
			"port": "",
			"username": "",
			"password": ""
		},
		"queue":"",
		"exchange":""
}


Filter example - 
	{
	[{"key1":"value1"},{"key2":"value2"}], // Objects inside array will be considered as OR filter operations
	[{"key3":"value3"},{"key4":"value4"}]  // Two or Arrays will be considered as AND filter operation among them
	
	}
	
	
Trigger Protocol:
amqp-input
http-input-polling
http-input-webhook
sftp-input

Action Protocol
amqp-output
http-output
sftp-output


How to create external input/output
For Input: Create two services, 
	1. One for configuration and implement TriggerConfig interface 
	2. Second for trigger service and implement Trigger Interface
For Output: Create two services,
	1. One for configuration and implement ActionConfig interface 
	2. Second for Action service and implement Action Interface
For Transformer: Create two services,
	1. One for configuration and implement TransformerConfig interface 
	2. Second for Transformer service and implement Transformer Interface
	
When running, the library will run all the config implementations first and after that it will run the trigger service which will then 
receivce the payload and then
